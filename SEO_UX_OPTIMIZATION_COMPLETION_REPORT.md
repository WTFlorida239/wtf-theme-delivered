3. **Image Attributes Enhancement**

### Purpose
Make analytics actionable for re-marketing & attribution with enriched context fields.

### Implementation Details

     - `wtf:cart:add` - Item added to cart
     - `wtf:checkout:begin` - Checkout process started
     - `wtf:purchase:complete` - Purchase completed
   - Automatically pipes events to Meta/GA4/TikTok
   - Enriches all events with context fields:
     - `template` - Current page template
     - `city` - Store city (Cape Coral)
     - `region` - Store region (FL)
     - `distance_km` - User distance from store (when geo available)

   - Tracked as `Lead` in Meta Pixel
   - Tracked as `generate_lead` in GA4
   - Tracked as `CompleteRegistration` in TikTok
   - Enables local re-targeting audiences

3. **Developer Debug Mode**
   - `window.WTF_ANALYTICS_DEBUG = true` flag
   - Echoes enriched payloads to console
   - Shows platform status (enabled/disabled)
   - Groups console output for easy debugging
   - Displays network requests in DevTools

4. **System Integration**
   - Auto-dispatches `wtf:system:ready` after initialization
   - Exports `window.WTFEventRouter` for external access
   - Backwards compatible with existing `WTFAnalytics` API
   - Enhanced `emitAll` with debug output

### Expected Impact
- **Re-marketing:** Local users automatically added to re-targeting audiences
- **Attribution:** Better understanding of user journey with enriched context
- **Conversion tracking:** Nearby users tracked as leads for ROI measurement
- **Developer experience:** Debug mode makes troubleshooting easy
- **Data quality:** Enriched context provides actionable insights

### Debug Output Example
```javascript
[WTF Analytics] Event: add_to_cart
  Enriched Payload: {
    page_type: "product",
    template: "product",
    city: "Cape Coral",
    region: "FL",
    distance_km: 12.3,
    value: 8.99,
    items: [...]
  }
  GA4: enabled
  Meta: enabled
  TikTok: enabled
```

### Testing Instructions
1. Enable debug mode: `window.WTF_ANALYTICS_DEBUG = true` in console
2. Navigate site and observe enriched event payloads
3. Check Network tab for Meta/GA4 requests with enriched data
4. Allow geolocation and verify `wtf:user:nearby` fires when within 25km

```

### Expected Impact

}
```

### Integration Notes

```

Backwards compatible with existing HTML structure:
- `[data-predictive-search-input]`
- `[data-predictive-search-results]`
- `[data-predictive-search-form]`

### Testing Instructions
1. Open search input on any page
