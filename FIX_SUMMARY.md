# Theme Editor 404 Fix - Summary Report

## Problem Identified

The Shopify Theme Editor was returning a **404 error** when attempting to customize the theme. This prevented merchants from using the built-in theme customization interface.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to `templates/index.json` which referenced three section files that did not exist in the theme:

1. `home-category-grid` - Referenced but missing
2. `home-visit` - Referenced but missing  
3. `home-footer-blurb` - Referenced but missing

When Shopify attempted to render the homepage template, it failed to find these required sections, resulting in a 404 error in the Theme Editor.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Missing Section Files

**`sections/home-category-grid.liquid`**
- Product category grid display
- Supports dynamic blocks for different product categories
- Includes proper schema for Theme Editor customization
- Responsive design with hover effects
- Follows established naming conventions

**`sections/home-visit.liquid`**
- Location and contact information display
- Address, phone, and hours display
- Map placeholder for future integration
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

**`sections/home-footer-blurb.liquid`**
- Call-to-action section for homepage
- Supports eyebrow text, heading, body content, and button
- Customizable through Theme Editor
- Professional styling consistent with theme

### 2. Fixed JSON Syntax Error

**`config/settings_data.json`**
- Removed invalid comment block that was causing JSON parse errors
- File now validates successfully with standard JSON parsers
- Maintains all existing configuration data

### 3. Added Documentation

**`CONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md`**
- Comprehensive analysis of theme naming conventions
- Confirms consistent use of kebab-case throughout
- Identifies minor gaps in collection template coverage
- Provides recommendations for future development

## Validation Results

### Theme Structure ✅
- All required Shopify theme directories present
- `layout/theme.liquid` contains required `{{ content_for_header }}` and `{{ content_for_layout }}`
- All referenced assets exist in the assets directory

### JSON Validation ✅
- All JSON files now parse successfully
- No syntax errors detected
- Schema structures are valid

### Liquid Validation ✅
- Theme-check passes with only minor performance suggestions
- No critical Liquid syntax errors
- All section schemas are properly formatted

### File Naming ✅
- Consistent kebab-case convention throughout
- No naming conflicts or inconsistencies
- Follows Shopify best practices

## Expected Outcome

**The Theme Editor should now load correctly without 404 errors**, allowing merchants to:

- Customize homepage sections through the visual editor
- Modify content, colors, and layout options
- Preview changes in real-time
- Publish customizations to the live theme
