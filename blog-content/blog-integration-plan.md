## Implementation Methods

### Option 1: Shopify Admin Interface (Recommended for Initial Publication)

This is the most straightforward method and doesn't require technical setup.

#### Steps:

1. **Access Shopify Admin**
   - Navigate to: `https://wtfswag.myshopify.com/admin`
   - Log in with admin credentials

2. **Navigate to Blog Posts**
   - Go to: **Online Store → Blog Posts**
   - Click **Add blog post**

3. **Create Each Blog Post**
   
   For each of the three blog posts:
   
   a. **Title:** Copy from the markdown file (H1 heading)
   
   b. **Content:** 
      - Copy the main body content from the markdown file
      - Use Shopify's rich text editor or HTML mode
      - Ensure proper formatting (headings, tables, blockquotes)
   
   c. **Excerpt:** 
      - Use the first 2-3 sentences as the excerpt
      - This will appear in blog listing pages
   
   d. **Search Engine Listing Preview:**
      - **Page title:** Use the "Meta Title" from the markdown file (≤60 chars)
      - **Description:** Use the "Meta Description" from the markdown file (≤155 chars)
      - **URL handle:** 
        - Post 1: `what-is-kava-cape-coral-guide`
        - Post 2: `natural-relaxation-evening-wind-down-swfl`
        - Post 3: `kratom-strains-guide-cape-coral`
   
   e. **Blog:** Select the main blog (likely "News" or "Blog")
   
   f. **Author:** Set to appropriate author
   
   g. **Tags:** Add relevant tags
      - Post 1: `kava, education, cape coral, botanical beverages`
      - Post 2: `lifestyle, relaxation, sober nightlife, wellness`
      - Post 3: `kratom, education, tea, cape coral`
   
   h. **Featured Image:** 
      - Upload a relevant, high-quality image
      - Add descriptive alt text (e.g., "Kava drink at WTF Cape Coral kava bar")
      - Recommended size: 1200×630px for social sharing

4. **Add Internal Links**
   
   Within each blog post content, add hyperlinks to:
   - Relevant product pages (e.g., "Custom Kava Drink", "Custom Kratom Tea")
   - Collection pages (e.g., "/collections/kava", "/collections/kratom")
   - About page or FAQ page
   - Store location/contact page
   
   **Example for Post 1:**
   ```html
   At <a href="/pages/about">WTF | Welcome To Florida</a>, we offer 
   <a href="/collections/kava">premium kava drinks</a> including our popular 
   <a href="/products/custom-kava-drink">Custom Kava Drink</a>.
   ```

5. **Publish Settings**
   - **Visibility:** Set to "Visible"
   - **Published date:** Set to current date/time or schedule for future
   - Click **Save** or **Publish**

### Option 2: GitHub Repository Integration (For Version Control)

If you want to manage blog content through GitHub:

#### Steps:

1. **Create Blog Content Files**
   - Add the three markdown files to a `blog-content` directory in the repository
   - Commit and push to the `main` branch

2. **Use Shopify API or Manual Sync**
   - Since automated sync may not be configured, manually copy content from GitHub to Shopify Admin
   - This method provides version control while still using Shopify's interface

### Option 3: Shopify Admin API (Advanced)

For automated publishing via API:

```bash
# Example using Shopify Admin API
curl -X POST "https://wtfswag.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-10/articles.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "article": {
      "title": "What is Kava? Your Complete Guide to Cape Coral's Favorite Botanical Beverage",
      "body_html": "<p>Blog content here...</p>",
      "blog_id": BLOG_ID,
      "published": true,
      "tags": "kava, education, cape coral"
    }
  }'
```

## Schema Markup Implementation

### Article Schema

Each blog post should include Article schema markup. This can be added via the theme's blog template or through Shopify's metafields.

**Example JSON-LD for Post 1:**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "What is Kava? Your Complete Guide to Cape Coral's Favorite Botanical Beverage",
  "description": "Explore the world of kava, a traditional botanical beverage gaining popularity in Cape Coral, FL.",
  "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/YOUR_STORE/kava-guide-featured.jpg",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "WTF | Welcome To Florida"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "WTF | Welcome To Florida",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://wtfswag.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-10-24",
  "dateModified": "2025-10-24"
}
```

### FAQ Schema

For the FAQ sections within each blog post, add FAQPage schema:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is kava legal in Florida?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, kava is legal to purchase and consume in Florida for adults 21 and over."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Location:**
- Add schema to `snippets/seo-head.liquid` or `templates/article.liquid`
- Ensure it's dynamically populated based on article content
