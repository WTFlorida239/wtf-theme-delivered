This PR:
- Expands auto-tracked builder pages to include THC Drinks and THC Shots in snippets/wtf-analytics.liquid.
- Aligns THC Shots page flavor rotation mirroring with Theme Settings (shots_inherit_thc_flavors) and allows custom overrides when mirroring is off.

Also verified:
- Analytics & Pixels settings section exists in config/settings_schema.json.
- Kratom/Kava legacy builders are guarded behind request.design_mode.

Follow-ups (outside this PR):
- Fill Theme Settings variant IDs for canned/draft/take-home pages.
- Validate THC Drinks page Liquid numeric comparisons to avoid type errors.
- Continue Admin API data wiring and navigation links once token scopes are confirmed.
