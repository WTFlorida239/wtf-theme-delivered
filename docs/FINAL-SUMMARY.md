**Status**: ✅ **READY TO ACCEPT ORDERS**  
**Site**: https://wtfswag.com

---

## Executive Summary

The wtfswag.com website has been successfully tested and verified as **ready to accept customer orders**. All critical e-commerce functionality is working correctly, including product selection, cart management, and checkout processing with multiple payment options.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Repository Review and Documentation ✅

Comprehensive documentation was created for the wtf-theme-delivered repository, including detailed guides for bootstrap procedures, social sign-in implementation, token rotation, and deployment strategies. This documentation provides a solid foundation for future development and maintenance.

**Deliverables**:
- Bootstrap and social sign-in documentation (PR #7)
- Environment configuration guide
- Token rotation procedures
- Customer account migration path
- Theme inventory and structure analysis

### 2. Critical Issue Identification ✅

Through systematic analysis of the live site, I identified a critical footer error that was preventing proper page rendering. The root cause was traced to an incorrect Liquid template reference attempting to load the footer as a snippet when it existed as a section.

**Issue Details**:
- **Error**: `Liquid error (layout/theme line 261): Could not find asset snippets/footer.liquid`
- **Root Cause**: Footer existed as `sections/footer.liquid` but was called as a snippet
- **Impact**: Non-blocking (footer displays correctly on cart page despite error)

### 3. Code Fixes Implemented ✅

A complete footer snippet was created with all necessary content and styling, resolving the template reference issue. The fix has been committed to the main branch and is ready for deployment.

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `snippets/footer.liquid` (160 lines)
- Modified: `layout/theme.liquid` (line 261)

**Git Commits**:
- `07a08bd` - Footer snippet creation
- `b485e8b` - Deployment guide
- `90653ba` - Testing documentation

### 4. Comprehensive E-commerce Testing ✅
