## Status Legend

- ‚úÖ **Done:** Feature complete and validated
- ‚è≥ **Pending:** Implemented but needs activation/coordination
- üî¥ **Failing/Blocked:** Active issue requiring immediate attention
- üìã **Planned:** Documented and scoped, not yet started
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **In Progress:** Active development underway

---

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK üî¥
1. **GitHub Actions Failures** (300 pts)
   - **Impact:** CI/CD pipeline broken, deployment automation affected
   - **Mitigation:** Investigate workflow logs, verify PAT permissions, update secrets
   - **Dependencies:** Repository secrets, workflow configurations

2. **Shopify Admin API Access** (150 pts)
   - **Impact:** Cannot programmatically manage store, automation blocked
   - **Mitigation:** Verify app installation, regenerate token if needed
   - **Dependencies:** Shopify Admin access, app permissions

### MEDIUM RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **Production Payment Gateway** (200 pts)
   - **Impact:** Cannot process real transactions until activated
   - **Mitigation:** Coordinate with 2Accept for production credentials
   - **Dependencies:** Business approval, merchant account setup

4. **Lightspeed POS Sync** (250 pts)
   - **Impact:** Inventory discrepancies between online and POS
   - **Mitigation:** Test sync in staging, validate SKU mapping
   - **Dependencies:** POS system access, API credentials

5. **Inventory Alert Testing** (150 pts)
   - **Impact:** Stock-outs not detected, customer experience degraded
   - **Mitigation:** Test alert thresholds, validate Slack integration
   - **Dependencies:** Slack webhook, POS sync, threshold configuration

### LOW RISK ‚úÖ
- All other features have low risk profiles with clear mitigation paths
- Most low-risk items are post-launch optimizations
- Documentation and training materials are complete

---

## Dependency Map

### Blocking Dependencies
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Üí All automated workflows (testing, deployment, monitoring)
- **Shopify Admin API** ‚Üí Inventory sync, automated updates, monitoring
- **Business Approval** ‚Üí Production launch, payment activation, staff training
- **Lightspeed POS** ‚Üí Inventory accuracy, stock alerts, SKU management

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **API Access** must be fixed before **Inventory Sync** can be tested
2. **Business Approval** must be obtained before **Payment Gateway** activation
3. **Launch** must occur before **Post-Launch Monitoring** can begin
4. **Customer Accounts Mode** must be verified before **Social Sign-In** setup

### Parallel Opportunities
- **Staff Training** can occur alongside **Payment Gateway** setup
- **Performance Monitoring** can be configured during **Business Approval** wait
- **PR #9 Review** can happen independently of critical path items
- **Email Marketing** setup can proceed while awaiting launch
