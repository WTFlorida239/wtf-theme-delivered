## Cart & Social Media Integration Summary

This document summarizes the recent improvements to the WTF Theme, focusing on cart persistence and social media integration.

### **1. Enhanced Cart Persistence**

A new, robust AJAX cart system has been implemented to resolve issues with items not persisting in the cart. The new system includes:

- **`wtf-enhanced-cart.js`**: A dedicated JavaScript module that handles all cart operations, including adding, updating, and removing items.
- **`wtf-drink-builder-enhanced.js`**: An updated version of the drink builder that works seamlessly with the new cart system, ensuring that custom drink configurations are correctly added to the cart.
- **Proper Event Handling**: The system now uses a consistent set of events to track cart changes, ensuring that the cart is always up-to-date across all components.
- **Error Handling**: The cart system includes error handling and retry logic to gracefully manage any issues that may arise during cart operations.

### **2. Social Media Integration**

To enhance the theme's social media presence, a comprehensive social media integration has been implemented:

- **`social-media-icons.liquid`**: A new snippet that dynamically renders social media icons based on the theme's settings.
- **SVG Icons**: The snippet uses inline SVG icons for all social media platforms, ensuring high-quality, fast-loading graphics.
- **Theme Settings**: The `settings_schema.json` file has been updated to include a new "Social Media" section, allowing for easy management of social media URLs from the theme editor.
- **Header and Footer Integration**: The social media icons have been added to the header and footer sections, providing prominent and aesthetically pleasing links to the brand's social media profiles.

### **3. Testing and Verification**

To ensure the quality and stability of these new features, a comprehensive testing process was followed:

- **`test-functionality.html`**: A dedicated test file was created to verify the functionality of the cart system and social media integration in a controlled environment.
- **Node.js Script**: A Node.js script was used to validate the presence and correctness of the new files and configurations.
- **Manual Testing**: The changes were manually tested to ensure that the cart and social media features work as expected on the live theme.

### **4. Code Commits**

All changes have been committed to the `main` branch of the repository and pushed to the remote. The commit history provides a detailed record of the changes made.

Overall, these improvements provide a more reliable and user-friendly cart experience and enhance the theme's social media integration, contributing to a more professional and engaging online presence.
